# EsportsBot AI

**EsportsBot AI** is an LLM-powered chatbot that delivers real-time esports earnings, player stats, and tournament insights—instantly.  
It connects Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash with the Esports Earnings API to fetch live data and summarize it in plain, conversational language.

## 🚀 Features
- **Real-Time Data** – Get up-to-date earnings and rankings for players, teams, and games.
- **LLM-Powered Understanding** – Natural language queries interpreted into accurate API calls.
- **User-Friendly Interface** – Built with Streamlit for a clean, responsive chat experience.
- **Robust Architecture** – Handles API errors, missing data, and dynamic game ID lookups.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. User enters a question (e.g., *"Who is the highest-earning Dota 2 player?"*).
2. Gemini 2.0 Flash parses the query and maps it to the correct API endpoint.
3. Esports Earnings API provides the requested data.
4. The LLM summarizes the results into a concise, human-readable answer.
